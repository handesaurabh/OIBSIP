# Temperature Converter

A responsive web application for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin units with real-time conversion and validation features.

## Objectives

- Create an intuitive and user-friendly temperature conversion tool
- Support conversion between three temperature units: Celsius (째C), Fahrenheit (째F), and Kelvin (K)
- Implement real-time conversion as users type
- Provide comprehensive input validation including absolute zero checks
- Ensure responsive design for all device sizes
- Offer quick reference information for common temperature points

## Steps Performed

1. **Project Setup**
   - Created HTML structure with semantic elements
   - Implemented CSS styling with gradient backgrounds and modern UI components
   - Developed JavaScript functionality with object-oriented approach

2. **Core Features Implementation**
   - Built TemperatureConverter class to handle all conversion logic
   - Implemented event listeners for user interactions (button clicks, key presses, input changes)
   - Added real-time conversion functionality
   - Created comprehensive input validation system
   - Developed temperature formatting and display functions

3. **Validation & Error Handling**
   - Implemented input validation for numeric values
   - Added checks for absolute zero limits (-273.15째C, -459.67째F, 0K)
   - Created error display system with visual feedback
   - Added same-unit conversion handling

4. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Added keyboard support (Enter key conversion)
   - Implemented visual feedback for user actions
   - Created responsive design for mobile devices
   - Added quick reference information section
   - Included welcome message and result animations

5. **Technical Implementation**
   - Used object-oriented JavaScript with ES6 class syntax
